		I developed my interest of technology early in life due to my father. He is a software developer at a company called Integrasoft, and I always found his work fascinating.
		Throughout the years, I messed with computers and bit and took some computing classes in high school, but I really didn't get into the coding aspects of things until I got to college.
		To my surprise, and enjoyment, I actually liked coding. I have heard the horror stories about it, and trust me I have experienced a few of them myself, but at the end of the day it's something
		I truly enjoy doing. To get some real world experience in the Tech Industry, I worked two summers as an intern at the company my father works for, Integrasoft.
		My duties there were:
		
		<ul>
			<li> Developed test cases </li>
			<li> Worked side-by-side with developers and customers </li>
			<li> Led meetings with our off-shore development team based in India </li>
			<li> Ran my own project dealing with inventory software as Head Tester </li>
			<li> Tested previously found bugs </li>
			<li> Input my thoughts on design of some features that made it to production </li>
		</ul>

		As good as my experience at Integrasoft was, I wanted to test out the waters of a large company. Luckily, I landed an a position as an IT intern for John Deere, my dream compnay. 
		This summer, I will be working on the Market Order Code Information team and be assisting with project management.	
		I am super excited for the opportunities that this internship
		opens up for me and my future in the Technology field!
